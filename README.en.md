- Open `parallelotris.html`

## Configuration

In the file, `src/options.js`, you will find the list of configurable options:

```
const OPTIONS = {
    POURCENTAGE_PIECE_ET_PROPS: 70, // PERCENTAGE CHANCE OF HAVING 2 PROPERTIES DURING A DRAW
    Pieces: {
      QUAD_QUELCONQUE: {            // IRREGULAR QUADRILATERAL
        code: 0,                    // INTERNAL REPRESENTATION, DO NOT MODIFY
        pourcentageTirage: 60,      // CHANCE OF APPEARANCE PERCENTAGE (excluding two properties drawn by POURCENTAGE_PIECE_ET_PROPS)
        score: 0                    // BONUS SCORE ON CREATION (0 here because the irregular quadrilateral cannot be formed from other pieces)
      },
      PARALELOGRAMME: {             // PARALLELOGRAM
        code: 1,                    // INTERNAL REPRESENTATION, DO NOT MODIFY
        pourcentageTirage: 20,      // CHANCE OF APPEARANCE PERCENTAGE (excluding two properties drawn by POURCENTAGE_PIECE_ET_PROPS)
        score: 50                   // BONUS SCORE ON CREATION
      },
      RECTANGLE: {                  // RECTANGLE
        code: 2,                    // INTERNAL REPRESENTATION, DO NOT MODIFY
        pourcentageTirage: 15,      // CHANCE OF APPEARANCE PERCENTAGE (excluding two properties drawn by POURCENTAGE_PIECE_ET_PROPS)
        score: 100                  // BONUS SCORE ON CREATION
      },
      LOSANGE: {                    // RHOMBUS
        code: 3,                    // INTERNAL REPRESENTATION, DO NOT MODIFY
        pourcentageTirage: 5,       // CHANCE OF APPEARANCE PERCENTAGE (excluding two properties drawn by POURCENTAGE_PIECE_ET_PROPS)
        score: 100                  // BONUS SCORE ON CREATION
      },
      CARRE: {                      // SQUARE
        code: 4,                    // INTERNAL REPRESENTATION, DO NOT MODIFY
        pourcentageTirage: 0,       // CHANCE OF APPEARANCE PERCENTAGE (0 here because the square should not appear but only be formed)
        score: 200                  // BONUS SCORE ON CREATION
      }
    },
  }
